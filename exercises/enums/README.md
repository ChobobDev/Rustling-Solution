# Enums

Rust allows you to define types called "enums" which enumerate possible values.
Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each language. Rustâ€™s enums are most similar to algebraic data types in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.
Useful in combination with enums is Rust's "pattern matching" facility, which makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enumeration.
